# Final projects

We are very excited to see your final project presentations next week!

Please fork this repository, commit your work and then make a pull request
to turn it in. If you worked as a group, only one person needs to submit,
but please note the members of your team in e.g. a README document. We'd
also like to see any shell / python / R code you wrote, and it would be
great if you created a short Rmarkdown document with some key results.

As a reminder, we are expecting each presentation to consist of ~3 slides:

1. Background
2. Code you are proud of
3. Result

Logistics:

Date: May 2 from 1-3pm
Place: RC1 South 9th floor

Please bring your own laptops for presentations, there are VGA and HDMI connections.

We'll be heading to happy hour after the final presentations, bring your
ID.
